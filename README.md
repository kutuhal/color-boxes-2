# color-boxes-2

###What it does?
It creates a block with colorful boxes which changes as mouse moves over it and when mouse is pressed

###Why?
This was created to crystalize JavaScript learning on:
* Generating HTML using Javascript _(all the color boxes are generated using javascript)_
* Events like onmousedown, onmouseover and onload

And also to reinforce the basic knowledge of CSS.
